## Overview
The lecture discusses techniques to structure B specifications using multiple B machines. It introduces modularization and abstraction to manage complexity in system designs and explores structuring clauses like `INCLUDES`, `PROMOTES`, `EXTENDS`, `SEES`, and `USES`.

## Key Concepts

### Complex System States
- A system’s state can be decomposed into multiple sub-states (components) to simplify management and improve modularization.
- Each sub-state is modeled using a different B machine.

## Structuring B Specifications

### Advantages of Structuring
1. **Modularity:**
   - Separation of concerns.
   - Aids understanding.
   - Enables module reuse.

2. **Abstraction:**
   - Information hiding.
   - Separation of specification and implementation.

## Structuring Clauses

### 1. **INCLUDES**
- Incorporates another machine’s data and operations but hides its interface.
- Example: Machine `Locks` includes `Doors`.
  - The `Locks` machine can access the state and operations of `Doors`.

### 2. **PROMOTES**
- Promotes selected operations of an included machine to the interface of the including machine.
- Example: Safes machine promotes `opendoor` and `lockdoor` operations from `Locks`.

### 3. **EXTENDS**
- All operations of the extended machine are promoted.
- Example: Machine `Registrar` extends `Marriage`, inheriting all its operations.

## Examples of Structuring B Machines

### Example 1: Bank Safes Specification
- **B Machines:**
  1. **Doors**: Handles the open/closed states of doors.
  2. **Keys**: Manages keys and their insertion/removal.
  3. **Locks**: Tracks locked/unlocked states and includes the `Doors` machine.
  4. **Safes**: Combines `Locks` and `Keys`, promoting necessary operations.

#### Safes Machine Operations
1. **insert (key, door):** Inserts a key into a door.
2. **extract (key, door):** Removes a key if the door is locked.
3. **unlock (door):** Unlocks the door if the correct key is inserted.
4. **quicklock (door):** Locks the door and removes the key.

### Example 2: Registrar Specification
- **B Machines:**
  1. **Life**: Records births and deaths.
  2. **Marriage**: Handles marriages and divorces, uses `Life` machine.
  3. **Registrar**: Combines `Life` and `Marriage` using `INCLUDES` and `EXTENDS`.

#### Registrar Machine Operations
1. **dies (person):**
   - Calls `Life`’s `die` operation.
   - If the person is married, calls `Marriage`’s `part` operation to update records.

## SEES vs. USES Clauses
- **SEES**: Provides read access to a machine’s state but does not allow state dependency.
- **USES**: Allows state dependency, enabling a machine to relate its state to another.

## Conclusion
Structuring techniques like `INCLUDES`, `PROMOTES`, and `EXTENDS` provide flexibility in designing B specifications. Modularization and abstraction reduce complexity and enhance software maintainability.
