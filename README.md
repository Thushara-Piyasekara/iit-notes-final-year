# Final Year Notes Repository

This repository contains my notes, lecture slides, and tutorial code for my final year of studies. The notes are managed using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a powerful knowledge base and note-taking app that allows note taking in markdown format. Although Obsidian supports note linking, I chose not to use it in this repository to keep each week's documents separate. If you use Obsidian for personal notes, I recommend trying the linking feature as it can be very helpful.

## Contents

- **Lecture Slides**: PDFs of the slides used during lectures.
- **Tutorial PDFs**: PDFs or images of weekly tutorials.
- **Lecture Notes**: Notes taken during lectures, outlining key concepts, explanations, and discussions. Some of the notes are incomplete. They were written during lectures to help understand the concepts for myself.
- **Tutorial Code**: Code snippets and solutions from tutorials and exercises. You can find the `.mch` code for formal methods module and `.lts` files for concurrent programming lecture. Please note these files are scattered through the repository.
